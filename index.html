<h3>Assignment: The main purpose of this course is to develop a digital humanities project and to expand on lessons learned in the core courses. As such, the course will culminate in a 2,500 to 3,500 word research paper and a ten to fifteen-minute presentation. Alternatively, students can develop an online project (with a similar amount of content) or creative visualization project in consultation with the instructor or another advisor. Think about creating something that you can add to a portfolio that will help you as you move forward!

<h3>On Friday the 25th of May the main hall of Leiden University was filled with professors, students and interested persons. They were listening to the lecture of Alan Pargas, professor of American culture and history at the same university. This lecture, called 'Promised lands: seeking freedom in the age of American slavery', addressed the topic of slavery and the questions it poses to academics.  The multitude of attendants indicated that questions related to slavery, freedom and equal rights are still very popular. 
	This essay is in two ways related to a modern (academic) debate on slavery. First of all it aims to embed itself in the discussion about the phenomenon of slave transports. The economic, political and demographic impact on Europeans, Americans and Africans is still, 150-200 years after the abolition of slavery on the Western Hemisphere, a fundamental part of societies on both side of the Atlantic Ocean. Secondly, the author of this essay chose to work with digital tools and data. Parts of this digital methodology have been thoroughly studied throughout the minor Digital Humanities, of which this essay is the conclusion.  The minor offered outstanding possibilities for this research. Slavery, globalization and digitalization are some of the most debated topics within contemporary humanities. Digitalization has paved a new way of conducting research: It involves changes from the tracing of source material, to data analysis, visualization techniques and the dissemination of results.  Thirdly, the author of this essay aims at mastering and experimenting with some of the obtained skills. The main purpose of the assignment is ‘to develop a digital humanities project and to expand on lessons learned in the core courses.’  So besides the mere use of digital tools, my advice and experience are shared throughout the essay, thus contributing to the projects and efforts of future students.
	Both regarding the crucial combination of the above mentioned humanities topics and the restricted size of the assignment, this essay touches upon the slave trade to Dutch Guyana (contemporary Surinam and Guyana). Between 1672 and 1973 the Dutch governed this colony. They tried to convince Dutch settlers to move to Guyana, where they could ultimately rule over their own plantations. Lacking a big and affordable workforce to support the plantation economy, the Dutch decided to ship enslaved Africans to Guyana.  These Africans, petrified by the horrible circumstances of their enslavement and transportation, soon toiled on the plantations.  With time passing, slaves escaped the plantations and formed the so-called 'maroon' settlements in the inaccessible jungle hinterland. Throughout the centuries these plantations, towns and maroon settlements expanded.  
	To what extent could a combination of  traditional literature, digital databases and tools like Excel, Global Information Systems (GIS) and Processing/P5.js visualize the link between Dutch slave transports to Guyana and the growth of the colony? This is the main inquiry of this essay. The author’s goal is to present a new way of conducting research by combining traditional and digital tools. These combinations occur on different levels. Foremost, the combination of digital and traditional methods creates the foundation for this research, which is partly written, partly digitalized. Besides that, using Processing/P5.js offers a rich ‘toolkit’ which enhances currently existing digital visualizations of slave trade.  Finally, using the GUIDE principles, the author is seeking for a way to share his method and results to a broader audience.  By providing accessible research results, Digital Humanities can present itself with a profound new way of data processing and dissemination. Not by the rejection of traditional research, but by cooperation, this position can be attained.  
	The core of this essay consists of three parts. In the first part the current historiography of Dutch slave trade to Guyana is discussed. What (digital) projects and research have been produced in the past? How could this essay contribute to this historiography. The second part examines the data, tools and methodology used for the author's visualizations and results. The final part obviously focuses on these results. What could be learned from the results and how could historians analyze these modern visualizations?
